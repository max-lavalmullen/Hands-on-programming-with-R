# Hands-on-programming-with-R
This project will keep track of my work as I progress through the book 'Hands-On Programming with R' by Garrett Grolemund. There are three projects throughout the book: a weighted die, a deck of cards, and a slot machine, which you will be able to find in the files above. I have modified these project a bit to make them more useful for potential users and so that I can highlight my skills rather than just copying from the book, but my modifications do not incur greater space or time complexity nor do they require more lines of code.
